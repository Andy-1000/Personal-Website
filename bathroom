  <br><h1>Late Night Bathroom Ramblings</h1>
  <hr style='float: right; width:83%;'><p class='date'>20th January 2022</p>
  <br>
  <p><i>
  Note: 
  I have never been one to write recollections, reflections or journal entries of any kind; however, this is probably that closest I have come.
  Furiously scribbled in the back of some notebook, I was struck rereading it.
  So, here I have faithfully typed up those curious and sometimes ridiculous ramblings...
  Let me know if you can make anything of it.
  </i></p>
  <br>
  <p>
  It was a cool evening and it was time to go to bed.
  I lay and I eat: 'bread in bed' I call it, just enough to abate my teenage appetite (huh... maybe that's where that word comes from).
  After finishing my fourth piece, I go to the bathroom next to my room and sit down on the toilet, where I notice a flurry of ants aimlessly dancing around the toilet roll.
  Intrigued, I investigate further, but to no apparent avail - I have no clue as to purpose of their prescence...
  Perhaps they were simply striving to achieve that age old adage, 'ants in your pants'.
  Whatever their reason, I saw no sanity in wiping myself with small biting insects, and, picking up the roll, dispersed them with a brush of my hand.
  </p>
  <p>
  I now found myself holding a roll of toilet paper and staring into the depths of that shiny white bowl.
  It seems fitting that what should start in a bowl should also end in a bowl... 
  But alas, I digress.
  Here I found myself looking inside the bowl, and what should I see but a smear of, shall we say, byproducts of byproducts.
  <i>Nothing for it</i> I thought.
  I lie.
  What I actually thought was <i>Oh gross I don't really want to go anywhere near that with my hand, let alone with a mere square of toilet paper.</i>
  At this point it is important to add that I had completely forgotten the existence of that oh-so-useful tool, the toilet brush (only as I write this now have of thought of it, and having done so will promptly use it... Excuse me for a moment).
  Anyway, what occured was that I went down to fulfill toilet paper's divine purpose, that is 'to wipe', and well, there's no easy way to put this.
  </p>
  <p>
  I dropped the entire toilet roll into the toilet.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was as stunned as you are now.
  What could I do?
  16 years of life experience had not prepared me for such an event.
  For a start I could pull it out of the toilet, but what then?
  I could try to flush it, or put it in the bin, sodden and dirty as it was.
  In fact, this roll was the very epitome of 'soggy'.
  Take as much time to picture that as necessary. 
  Eventually I ended up putting the roll on top of the toilet, where I will probably see it tomorrow and all this will flood back into my head like toilet water.
  </p>
  <p>
  The mess now dealt with, I tried to put the incident behind me (literally).
  Serenely I sat on the toilet and began to ponder the mysteries of the universe...
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Why weren't toilets black (so as to hide their desecration)?</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Why is toilet paper not called toilet towels, like paper towels?</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>What would I do if there was no more toilet paper?</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  Suddenly all that anxiety and stress which I had experienced only moments ago came back with as much force as I had just applied on the toilet.
  I rued to think that I might have been reduced to using wet tp; no, not just wet, but soggy, soaked and squishy.
  Thankfully there were two spare rolls: one normal and one with an imprint of Donald Trump's face printed on each square (a Christmas gift).
  I opted for the normal roll.
  </p>
  <p>
  And that's it.
  I don't know what struck me to write this brief snapshot of my life down, but I did, and hopefully I was able to keep toilet humour strictly out of it.
  It's not like I'm some immature five year old...
