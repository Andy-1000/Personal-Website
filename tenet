  Tenet is the most Christopher Nolan-esq movie you will ever see. 
  While Time is an underlying belief in most of his film, in Tenet, Time is the primary underlying mechanism. 
  Most of the time, time travel in a movie is a bit of a red flag - I don't know if I've ever seen an top notch movie with time travel. 
  Tenet however does not use time travel; instead, reversed entropy, which causes object to run backwards in time. Like most of Nolan's science fiction, it's based on a very solid scientific foundation (In Feynman diagrams anti-particles actually do move backwards in time).
  </p>
  <p>
  The plot of the movie runs almost along Bond lines - a sinister villain threatens to destroy the world, and the protagonist must stop this from happening. And yes, the protagonist in this movie is only known throughout the movie as The Protagonist. Personally, I like this  as an idea because it suggests on a postmodern level that the protagonist could be anyone, that this is just a story and the protagonist is expected to fulfil his role and remove the antagonists (yeah, bad guys are also referred to as antagonists as well).
  </p>
  <p>
  What makes Tenet so different is the use of this reverse entropy mechanism is a variety of contexts, and man does it look sick. From people moving backwards in time to fight scenes, car chases and battle scenes. What makes it even better is that you are able to see two sides of the exact same scene: one from the perspective of the Protagonist moving forward in time, and another from the Protagonist moving backwards in time.

  Unfortunately this insane visual masterpiece comes at a cost. There is minimal emotion depth - some sob story about a child we never see doesn't really cut it. Contruction of character depth is traded instead for exposition, although the exposition of this particular movie is comparably pretty interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some people seem to think the plot of Tenet is too complex and doesn't resolve itself. Personally, I very much disagree. A first watch may leave you confused plot-wise, but very much satisfied in terms of visual entertainment. A second watch allows for a greater understanding of plot and the mechanism at play. While some may think that a movie should be able to be fully appreciated on its first watch, I consider this level of depth refreshingly uncharacteristic of Hollywood movies, which seem to consider the average viewer to be of below-average intelligence. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Other than this, dialogue is razor sharp, and the score is bold but superb. Because the soundtrack sometimes drowns out dialogue, subtitles are very recommended - a small price to pay for a much greater viewing experience.

  8.2/10
