  'If you want to become a good magician, you've got to get your hands dirty'
  </p>
  <p>
  Secrets, lies, murder... all in the name of magic. A professional rivalry between two magicians escalates to dangerous levels. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Like most Christopher Nolan movies, the plot has brain-twistingly expansive depths. Because of this, not a single second is wasted; rewatching reveals so much more and makes even more sense, especially with respect to the twists.
  </p>
  <p>
  Contrasting on the firm foundation of its historical period, I was initially thrown by the elements of sci-fi thrown in. But, while some movies may employ elements of sci-fi for mere plot conviences (think marvel movies), its use here was in fact intergral to the plot, aiding also to the underlying themes playing throughout the movie.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, I was a bit fan of the fact that there wasn't really a good guy or a bad guy - in the end it was up to the audience to decide for themselves. The way Nolan wrote it was that the audience may initially root for Angier/The Great Danton, but by the end are instead rooting for Borden/The Professor. Or, is Angier simply a victim of what Borden wrought upon him?
  </p>
  <p>
  8.4/10
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Additional Notes (SPOILER ALERT):
  </p>
  <p>
  1. Were the twins in fact cloned? To recommend Tesla to Angier, one of them must have known. If so, it would have had to have been the innocent twin, because the condemned twin should have known about the trick and wouldn't have been surprise to see Angier alive.
  </p>
  <p>
  2. When Borden's wife hangs herself, it is not in fact because her husband is having an affair, but because she somehow learns she has married two men - this is what she threatens she will tell the mistress
  </p>
  <p>
  3. At the same as the events of the movie it is implied also that Tesla and Edison are having a similar rivalry which is also escalating
  </p>
  <p>
  4. Cutter knew from the very beginning that Borden was using a double, and was thus unsurprised when it was as if Borden was still alive
  </p>
  <p>
  5. In the climatic sequence after Angier is shot, Angier's dialogue for why they did what they did could easily be likened to Nolan's prerogative behind the movie also: 'it was the looks on their faces... The world is bleak and miserable... solid all the way through... but if just for a second you could make them wonder...'</p>
